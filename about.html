    <h1>About Us</h1> 
    <!-- typing animation here!-->

    <h4 id = "welcome">Welcome to Edison High School Model United Nations, where we aim to provide delegates with a genuine and authentic simulation of the United Nations. Our goal is to strengthen delegates’ skills in leadership, debate, and public speaking, while also helping them become more informed global citizens.

Traditionally, our delegates attend numerous local conferences, and we also aim to attend 1-2 large-scale conferences annually. We also host our own conference, EHSMUN, as a launchpad for delegates to gain some experience and practice with Model UN ideas.
